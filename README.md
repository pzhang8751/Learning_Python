# Learning_Python
This is all of the code I have done in the past year. It includes the basics of Python, GUI, SQL, matplotlib, pandas and more. 

A lot of these files are old practice programs that I have done. You can tell what I was practicing by the file name or the imports. 
As I have said, many of these programs are just practicing and working on various topics. Such as making GUIs with tkinter, analzying/ 
visualizing data with pandas, practicing loops and data sorting.
